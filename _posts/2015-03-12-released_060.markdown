I am really proud on this one. The new Pattern Matrix view will help you to arrange your patterns
like (or for) the plugins 'Live Dive', 'Grid Pie' or 'Cells'.

Documentation will be updated soon.

You can download the Plugin [here]( {{site.baseurl }}/downloads/Stepp0r-0.60.xrnx ),
[here](http://www.renoise.com/tools/stepp0r) or use the
[Renoise-Update-Checker](http://www.renoise.com/tools/update-checker).
